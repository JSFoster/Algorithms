# Algorithms
Playing around with algorithms in Java written from scratch.

Trying to go into each algorithm with knowledge on how it works but not how to program it.
This is definitely not written to be the best implementation. I'll go back later to improve them.

Currently includes Selection sort, Insertion sort and Merge sort.
